Genesis is a mod for Minecraft that aims to completely overhaul the vanilla progression system. It does this using newly added blocks, items, and an innovative Age system that locks content behind goals. While Genesis significantly revamps progression, it’s designed to remain intuitive and approachable for new players. You won’t need to rely on external guides. Genesis provides in-game guidance to help you on your journey.

This is especially relevant, for as the new Age system locks content for even core items, such as iron armor, diamond tools, furnaces, and more.

Additionally, to access The End and defeat the Ender Dragon, you must first:

*   Go to the Nether
*   Visit the Pale Garden
*   Complete an Ocean Monument
*   Explore an Ancient City
*   Kill the Wither
